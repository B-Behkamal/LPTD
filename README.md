Linear Programming-based Topology Determination Method for Cryo-EM Maps


LPTD software has been built using MATLAB R2020a. The LPTD is an automatic topology determination method for intermediate resolution cryo-EM maps. 

There are two options to use LPTD as follows. (i) The first one is for the cases when the native topology is available. In such case, one can refer to the ReadMe_1 file and follow the description to generate the topology by LPTD (LPTD_Function_1.m) and calculate the performance measurements (Precision, Recall, F1-score, accuracy) as well as the rank of the correct topology. In the ReadMe_1 file, there is a full description of how one can run the LPTD method on the data set of the paper entitled “LPTD: A Novel Linear Programming-based Topology Determination Method for Cryo-EM Maps”. Moreover, one can find the results of the paper obtained by LPTD. (ii) The second one (LPTD_Function_2.m) has been developed for the user who would like to find the alpha-helix and beta-sheet topologies for new proteins. In this case, please refer to the ReadMe_2 file for more clarification
